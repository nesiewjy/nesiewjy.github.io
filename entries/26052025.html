            <p>My order of the water filter can arrived.</p>
          
            <p>Me and my housemates did a little water tasting at home. We compared the filtered and unfiltered. I said it tasted sweeter. C said it’s more bitter, especially he can feel more at the back of his tongue. S said the filtered one felt more “wet,” like soft in the mouth.</p>
          
            <p>I loved how he described it. What does it mean for water to be more wet?</p>
          
            <p>Water is amazing like that—so present, so essential, yet it slips away from words. My body is made of it, but can never quite describe it. Everyone experiences water differently, from moment to moment. It’s always flowing, merging, shifting. It cannot be grasped.</p>
          
            <p>I was reading an interview with Lucien Castaing-Taylor from <i>Tubelight</i> #130<sup id="footnote-asterisk"><a href="#footnote">*</a></sup>. Lucien said, “we are sensing, somatic creatures before we are semiotic ones.”</p>
          
            <p>I keep thinking about that. Before we speak, we feel. Before we name, we sense. I guess it’s something for me to approach the topic of water management.</p>
