        <p>As I throw things into my suitcase for yet another trip to China, my mind keeps wandering back to a batch of photos from last winter. Those shots were merely incidental snaps from a trip that felt more like a battle than an adventure, much stressed by my graduation. There’s this weird draw to these images, scenes from a place that’s technically “home” but doesn’t quite feel like it anymore. It’s this forgotten stretch of land, sandwiched between high-rises and a ghostly new school, untouched since I last passed through four years ago.</p>

        <p>Flipping through the photos, I realized I’ve been on a quest without really knowing it. I’ve been chasing the connection between people and their places, trying to pin down something that’s always just out of reach.</p>
    
        <p>And then there’s me, always on the move, always getting asked, “Where are you from? Will you stay?” It’s funny how “from” feels like a point in space I’m tethered to, yet “staying” seems like a concept I can’t quite grasp. As if I’m constantly searching for a place to root myself, knowing full well I might just pick up and leave again.</p>
    
        <p>My mom was pointing at the empty school when I flashed the photo. She told me how the school is important for people to purchase apartments, as today education for kids is the most important thing to choose a place to live. She did the same for me. Her parents settled down in a mining town for work. She got her job at the same company, and had me when she’s working in their smelting town. Then we moved from towns to cities. “But you should choose the place you want to go,” she told me, as much as she’s telling herself.</p>
