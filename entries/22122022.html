        <p>Sometimes I see arrays of sandwiches on shelves in the supermarket, I imagine how they have been produced in the factory: breads are trimmed into symmetrical shapes, and cheese are sliced into equal sheets. Each of them is defined, being labelled and priced at the same. Suddenly a strange comfort infused into my mind, a nostalgic feeling of my childhood was evoked, back to when everything around me was so clearly defined and seems equal. Although in fact a cheese sandwich never appeared in my childhood, itâ€™s not a traditional food in my country.</p></br>
