    <strong>Moving Underground</strong> <!--ðŸ”¹ Title -->
    <p>One of the biggest reasons I can never fully settle into this studio is that thereâ€™s no Wi-Fi. It gives me this strange feelingâ€”like living in the countryside, yet right in the middle of a lively city. It makes me restless, like I always need to go somewhere, just to escape the disconnection.</p>

    <p>In Berlin, public transport tickets come with a fixed price and are valid for unlimited travel within a two-hour window once activated. So whenever I take public transport, I find myself caught in the tension of strategizing. <i>how to stretch the ticket to its fullest, how to fit multiple trips into those two hours, how to make sure every ride counts...</i></p>

    <p>And every time, I canâ€™t stop thinking about skipping the ticket. The temptation is real.</p>

    <p>There are no ticket barriers stopping you from simply stepping onto a train or bus. It all comes down to whether you choose to follow the rules and pay or if youâ€™re willing to play a game of hide-and-seek with the inspectors, knowing you risk a fine if you lose.</p>

    <p>I heard about a website <a href="https://freifahren.org" target="_blank">freifahren.org</a>, where people anonymously report ticket inspections in Berlin, marking stations where an inspector has been spotted.</p>

    <p>So, in this offline room, with only a trickle of mobile data to spare, one of my favorite ways to pass the time has become monitoring public transportation inspectors on the site.</p>

    <p>I find it kind of fascinatingâ€”strangers unknowingly collaborating, looking out for each other in this quiet, fleeting way. I wonder how many people actually use it, how trustworthy the reports are. The map keeps shifting. New red dots appearing, disappearing. Signals flickering through the digital ether.</p>

    <p>Moving underground, along with an improvised system of trust.</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s a strange, small thrill, watching the cityâ€™s cat-and-mouse game unfold in real time, even as I sit here, disconnected.</p>
